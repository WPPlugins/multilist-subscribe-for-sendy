Multilist Subscribe for Sendy adds a subscribe widget to your WordPress website so you can send post notifications to all your Sendy.co mailing lists.


## Description 
Multilist Subscribe for Sendy integrates WordPress post notifications into one or more of your Sendy email marketing campaigns. Setup is easy and Sendy can leverage the power of Amazon's Simple Email Service (SES), or any SMTP relay service, for dependable email marketing.


### How to Use 
1. Navigate to "Sendy Email Templates", then "Add New", to create a Sendy campaign template associated with a post type - Subscribers to this campaign will receive the campaign emails when a new post of that post type is published.
1. Navigate to "Appearance", then "Widgets", and add a "Sendy Multilist" widget to your WordPress website - this is the subscribe form for the Sendy campaigns you created in the previous step.


## Installation 
1. Upload "sendy-multilist.zip" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.


## Frequently Asked Questions 

# Does this plugin include Sendy? 
No. Sendy is a separate product created by Sendy.co. You have 2 options:
1. Purchase your own license for the self-hosted installation from Sendy.co and set it up yourself.
1. Pay a monthly subscription to https://wplikeapro.com/services#subscribers for a hosted version of Sendy.co's solution - all the hard configuring done for you.


# Why are my post notifications being sent 
1. Make sure you copy/paste'd your List ID, API Key, etc.. exactly correct.
1. Make sure your Sendy Campaign Template is "Published".
1. If everything looks right, but the post notifications are still not being sent, open a support ticket in the plugin's WordPress directory page.


# Where do I find all these API keys, list ID's, etc... 
** Where do I find my API Key? **

Login to your Sendy account and click your account name (in the top right corner), then click "Settings".
Your API Key will be on the right-hand side of your Settings page. Copy that key and paste it into the "Sendy API Key" field, in your "Sendy Multilist" Widget.

** Where do I find my List ID?**

1. Login to your Sendy account and click "View All Lists" in the gray box located on the left. (If you have multiple "Brands" in your Sendy account, you must select a brand first).
1. When viewing the "Subscriber Lists" page, in Sendy, the "ID" Column contains the list IDs. Hover over the ID for the list you want to add to WordPress to select it, then use your keyboard to copy that value (Control + C on Windows, Command + C on Mac). Paste that value into the "List ID" field in your Sendy Campaign Template, in WordPress
